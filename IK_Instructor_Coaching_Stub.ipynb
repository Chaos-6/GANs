Halika it's gonna go. you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you let's wait for a few moments you you have attended the prompt engineering session and also the previous make automation session as well I attended the prompt engineering one this is the first one anyone attended the previous make automation I think manual is attended I have also attended the first class of the beta track for nature for nature no so I have attended the prompt engineering one this is the first one for the okay great great good nice so have you tried anybody who has attended beta track you know have you tried these automation you know have you tried these I think one anyone else from your team joining I do it good morning good morning good morning so happy to see you here well wouldn't miss it for the world thanks for showing okay anyone from assisted team has joined okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay We have 23 participants. Let's start. Pre-ish, are you there? Okay. Anyone who is on common group with SSA team because SSA team wanted to five minutes, five to ten minutes, extra buffer time. So I was just waiting for them. Let me drop a message. Karthika, you still have a hard stop at ten. I just wanted to reach you. So we'll be done by ten, right? Well, that's my humble request. Definitely definitely. We will do. Okay. Then let's start. Let them join. Okay. I hope my screen is visible to you all, right? Yes. Thanks for joining this session, guys. Let's make this very interactive. Thanks for your kind of cooperation with the prompt engineering session, because you may get it interactive till the end. So I just want the same cooperation in this session as well, so that we learn from each other. Now, you please stop me. Then in there, if you have any queries, then we'll resolve all the queries and then we'll go forward. Because for most of you guys, it would be very new to use any kind of AI tool. So let's make it very simple and then go slow, step by step. Okay. First, let me know how many of you have ever thought that, okay, I want to clone for myself. If there is some assistant who does my tasks, that'd be great. Especially when we face like some hectic covers. Now we have a face this. Yes. I'm seeing thumbs up from everyone. And guys, if it's possible, please turn on your camera, because only mine is on and I'm seeing all initials. If it's fine, please turn on so that I can see you guys and then, it'll be more interactive. Thanks. Thanks. They were thanks. And we're all good. Thank you. Great, guys. Okay. Just a second. Okay. So as we have all the face this one, scenario of cloning ourselves. And let's think of certain scenarios, which you repeatedly do. So one such scenario is clear. Like collecting feedback from the customers and analyzing them and then responding them, extending personalized response to response to each and every customer. So that is one of the repetitive tasks, right? So in these cases, we might think that what if AI could help is. So I just want to know from everyone of you, like what is the repetitive tasks that you are doing every day, that you feel that if AI could help here, that would say much of your time. Can it please unmute yourself and let me know. Or you can put it in the chat effect. Yes, emails definitely personalized. The emails is a very good use case. Definitely we have to do that. Yeah. I would say a curtaker of one, one gap that I see in English for the, for the PAS to be precise, right? That's that. See, while they are supposed to, well, most of the folks, they will put up notes after every call, right? But many times it happens because the positive time and put, they do a lot of stuff, right? They get more, they are not able to capture the notes and send a MOM to the, to the learner, right? Or they will, right? So I think that will be a good step, right? A tool which can automate or other, take the notes, right? And put it up, update those in HubSpot and then send the MOM to the needs and then let the PAS know that, yeah, this has been done. That will be a taste. Yeah, definitely. So that can be, like, MOM, all those things come sooner, personalized emails, right? So we have to take up the notes and then, right, we have to make sure the notes, the essence of the call, right? As a note and then, yeah, you can share the same note in a more formal way. The need, restructure. Yes, yes, yes. So that's that's one of the things. And as David has mentioned, you know, class performance analysis soon after every class gets over, it has to track the timing and then automatically gets triggered, take the analysis, take the subject to feedback form and analyze it and send, you know, the feedback to the instructor or to the internal team. So that will really be helpful. So that is one thing that we can automate. Amara has said that reach out to recruiters who have posted open roles on LinkedIn. Yeah, I'll, by the end of this session, you know, Mandra, I'll give you one tip and trick for doing this use case. Actually, there is some module which is available directly, so we can pick that up and do. We'll discuss that later. And Shveta has said auto updating dashboards, status alerts and follow up. Yeah, definitely. So see for example, if you are only for one week vacation, maybe this is festival time, right? So we might be on vacation after coming back. You might be seeing like hundreds of males in your inbox. You know, slack messages full like 100, 200, 250. Sometimes we feel like overwhelming even to look into our own inbox and reading the messages. And also slack messages, we, like there will be so many threads. We, I personally get lost when I see low, so many threads and so many notifications. So if there is an analysis like a bot goes and analyze, you know, in all these seven days, these are the activities that has happened. And if it could give a quick summary for us, that will really save a lot of our time once we resume back, right? So these kind of things we are trying to automate today. Keep on thinking about the use cases that will help you, definitely we are going to see all these things in the coaching session, but to start with just think of like this is a kind of automation what we are going to do is to save your time and helps will help you to be more productive. Okay, that's the idea. So for that, we are going to use it to, please, my screen is still shared. Yeah, okay. Fine. Now, what is this? We have discussed this process, right? It is going to carry out repetitive tasks without human intervention. There's no we discussed about certain tasks where AI could help us with that would carry out the repetitive tasks. For example, the personalized email like you will be having a notes like I have to send email to this person every day, every day, your list will change, but then your task will remind the same, right? So that we are going to do with the help of without any human intervention. So this process is called as automation and we are going to do some sort of automation in today's class. For example, now let's assume this scenario. If you have one AI assistant, just imagine you are having an AI assistant and it performs exactly what you asked to do. Now we are going to discuss on how would you train that AI assistant to write an email? Just imagine this month even I used to call out this example because this will be like a very more relatable example. I hope most of you guys would have was it is robot movie like there is a Chiti robot, right? Where if you have to give instructions each and everything and if you are not giving instructions properly, instead of taking a means switching on the TV, it will put the TV down, put the TV because they would have said that put the TV. So it doesn't understand our language. We have to give clear instructions. That is very important for AI. So keep all these things in your mind and let me know if there is an AI assistant. Suppose imagine I am your AI assistant. Now tell me how will you train me to write an email? What are the steps involved? Like for example, open this. You have to go here. So how will you train me? Just let me know. Guys, this is very important. This thinking process changes the way how we deal with this tools to do automation. That is why I am asking you this question. So think of me as an AI assistant and let me know how will you train me to write an email? What will you do? What all the instructions you will give me step by step? Please unmute yourself and tell me. First, find the mail agent. Open a mail like a Gmail. Composed. At the end of the sender. Not sender. Receive a 2 to field. And subject. Then content with the body basically. And then we can go deeper into dividing the body into different parts introduction. Then the summary then the next CDA is the next step. Signature. This would be there by default. Yeah. So we have different tools. We have to use this tool to send an email. So step by step you will instruct the AI assistant in this way to write the email. So let us check one of the first steps. So it is open the email as application. So the AI assistant has to assume itself. Because it is your AI assistant. And it has to perform the task that you are doing. So you ask the AI assistant to assume certain rule. And then it has to understand the context in which context it has to draft that particular mail. See for example if it is a customer support agent. And it has to understand the context that I it has to draft a mail. There is a complaint. Customer complaint about some late delivery of a product. It has to understand the context for this context I have to draft a response. Then the deciding the tone. How it has to draft that particular mail. And then draft the exact mail and send the email including subject body. And what is the course of action you want to take with an apology. You want to talk about certain next steps. It has to detail that everything. Is it not similar to something that you have discussed earlier? I will create that assistant. I think we give them the content and we upload the entire content. Yes exactly in the previous prompting reading class also we did the same thing. It is RCFT framework. We kept all these things in mind. And then with the help of that we got the response. So always it is RCFT will help you to be very clear. Here also your prompting skills whatever you have learned in the previous session will help you. Terribly because at multiple places that is very much required. So just the takeaway of this pointer is that you have to be very clear in giving each and every step or instruction to the AI tool or agent anything. Now this kind of step by step instructions. What we are giving to the AI is called as a workflow. For example if you give the instructions as such. If it is in not in proper sequence or proper flow. First you are saying that you don't draft the subject and then send the mail then open the Gmail application. Does it make sense right? So it has to be in a proper flow. So defining the instructions step by step as a sequential flow it is called as workflow. So workflow just splitting it to do thing. Your work has to be explained in a proper flow that becomes a workflow for AI. So why should we automate the tasks when we are capable of solving these RC's? That we have discussed already that is because it saves a lot of time. If somebody is doing R tasks very important critical task. We can focus more on strategic aspects. Then every day if we are performing certain tasks we are humans are prone to errors. But when machines are doing that is the main thing. When we are doing R schooling we would have read about this computer. What is the advantage of computers? Humans are prone to errors but machines will not make errors. Such kind of manual errors could be avoided with the help of these AI tools. Then it obviously improves efficiency because we could complete if you are doing some sort of work for hours. If you could do that in 40 minutes definitely you could do tens of tasks in that 4 hours. So definitely this improves efficiency. Then workflow increases especially hectic times when workload increases without adding more manual effort. You could delegate some tasks to your AI assistant and you can scale much easier. It's like without adding more resources into our team we becoming more efficient, more and more efficient to handle multiple tasks. Now the prime question that will be in the mind of any one who thinks about automation. Because earlier it was like that. We definitely have to know coding to automate the tasks. Do we need to know coding now? No. No. Definitely no coding is not at all required. You can automate even without a single line of code that is what we are going to learn today. That's why these tools are becoming highly popular. Why are these gaining popularity? Because anyone can now automate anyone can create AI agents. The thing is that AI literacy is very very important. That's what we are here. There are multiple no-code automation tools available in the market. These are a few like make, Z appear, relevance, power automate by Microsoft, N8 and there are multiple such things available. In today's class we are going to make use of make. We'll explore this today. Automate our tasks with the help of the workflows that is available. Any doubts over? No card figure. Now, this is a very important aspect. We'll go like everything will come on the slides. The instructions and this will make you familiar with the environment, the make environment. So can you open your browser? Just go to make.com and then click on this get started free here or in the bottom. And then sign in with your intrupe kickstart credentials. Let's go step by step. As the slide progresses, we'll also do step by step. Oh, gosh. That's so... I'm feeling so happy to see this. I'm here to make you all do automation. Yeah, thank you. If you guys submit a lot of entries in the competition, that is the real success for me. Card figure for hosting region by default is showing you what you can change it to US also. That doesn't make much difference. And then country would keep it as India itself or do I do it? Yes, yes, yes. Yeah, no coding and agents that save time. Thank you. On make way of saying we have to go for get started free right? Yes, get started for free. Just click on that and then give you an intrupe kickstart credential. No, no. Okay. Guys, let me know if the comments like once you're done with this process. Yeah, glad. Don't write. Yeah. Oh, nice voice. Who's that? You can even automate your voice, know what's voice calls, everything. Or every day if you want to sing a song for someone, you can even do that. And send a WhatsApp message. Okay, I hope you guys would have done right now. Let's move on to the next step. Okay, so once you have logged in, did you get a screen like this? Guys, I'll give you some questions. How did you hear about make? Okay, just give some answers and then log in. So you should get a dashboard page like this. This is called as a dashboard. Should we be seeing your page? Cut you. Sorry, David. Should we be seeing your page? Yes, exactly. We come back to the combat to the. So, no, I think what David, David, means is that your your dashboard has. Sir, three data, right? How are you not have any? Yes, it's pretty plain right. It's very, very clean. Yeah, credit left thousand usage, reset, 30 days, those kind of stuff. Yes, you can analyze, you know, once you create the agents, you know, automation workflows, your credits will get reduced. You can keep track of all these things with the help of this dashboard. That's why this page is called as a dashboard, basically. See, if you see here, you know, there is plus creates scenario. You will come into these all these aspects, sometime later. Now, can you scroll down this dashboard page and go to the bottom of the dashboard page? Can you see some tutorials and then predefined templates for workflows? Yes, trending is suggested app, then trending is trending resources, use template. Yes, yes, this is very important. Even before starting, I want to mention about this because once you get to understand about how to do automation and these things, before starting your use case, I request all of you to get into these tutorials, checkout these things, and also some predefined templates are available, right? Just go and have a look into these, what kind of tasks are being automated for this task, which kind of modules should I use. So this will give you an idea of all these aspects. So just spend some time like one-art words, even before starting your use case into these tutorials and also the templates. This will give you a very good idea. Okay. Now, Okay. So some tutorials. One more thing I would like to mention, so in your app level, we have curated a few resources for you. Some videos which are really, which will really be helpful. In the video, you are going on searching YouTube or anywhere. We have collected some useful videos for you. Please do check that out as well once we finish this session before starting your use cases. That will also help you. For example, I don't want to rush for this particular use case for LinkedIn, jobs and all. Certain things would be helpful, right? So we have to use some kind of scrapers. So how to use a scraper inside this automation, all those details are available in the videos. Some advanced things which would be helpful for your particular use case, would be available in these videos. Just please check that out also. Now let's start with something simple. So, Start this one. So here on the top, you can see creates in your piece. Come back to this one screen. So you can see creates inari, right? So this question will be there in your mind. What is this scenario here in make? It is nothing but whatever we have discussed about workflow, right? A scenario in make is nothing but an automated workflow that is sequential step of our work. How it has to flow, connecting applications together. For example, I have to draft a mail and then send my mail via Gmail. I have to have the Gmail application ready, right? So connecting them in particular order makes this scenario. Okay. Now, if you click on that place, create scenario, right? Just click on that. If you click on that one, just observe this one. Let's discuss the flow together. And then you can experiment it yourself. And there are inic varies. Let's resolve them. So first, please look into this slide only because this will help you understand. Where we have to change the values and what kind of values we need to give for which module. So all these things, let's understand first. So you click on plus create. You will get a screen like this. Here, this red box indicates the name of the scenario. You can change it to any name. Then you get a circle like this colorful circle. And this is for adding modules. Modules. Now, we talked about scenario. Inside this scenario, we have to add new modules. So what is a module? Any application. We already discussed that a scenario is nothing but we are going to connect multiple applications together to complete our task. For example, if you want to send a message to Slack, you would be connecting Slack. If you want to send an email, you would be connecting a Gmail application. So whatever you want to do, that particular application has to be connected. And that application here, in make is referred to as module. Clear. Okay. Now, what is a module in make? It's a single building block in a scenario. One specific job. So writing email. One particular task will be taken care by one module. Like one step in a workshop. Any doubts of a? One question, Karthik. When we click on the plus sign, so the dropdown opens up. All the modules which can be used. Pretty much everything is there. But if there is a certain module, which is not there. Okay. I mean, my question is that we have to use this three defined modules. Or is there an option for using anything else? Maybe a little too much of it was a mistake. No, no. That's a good question. Definitely. See, for example, there are certain things. For example, LinkedIn, as I'm taking that example, because that would be easy to relate. For directly going and checking the post, there might not be any module or any option available. But there is a third part to application. There is one module. By which you can connect to that. So always, there is a way to complete the tasks. It might be like most of the frequently used applications. Or all introduced by, you know, make as modules definitely. Only certain, you know, niche tasks like very specific applications that might not be available. But definitely will be a worker on for that. We can explore that together and find out a way or not. Completing that task as well. Any other queries? Okay. Now here is our scenario. This is what we are going to do in our automation workflow. Like we want to fetch data from companies you are. And write a quick summary of it. Like for example, just imagine there are a few competitors of ours. You just go into the, how will we do competitive analysis before earlier? Just think of a few months before. Which is going to the website and then a list down all the courses that's available in the company is a URL and then we'll analyze it right. So similarly, there is something some new company. And then we want to get the data from that particular URL. How would we create a summary from that URL? That's what we are going to do. It's not going to be very detailed. But then just going into the URL and then creating a summary. Let me know like earlier we have split it into the email. We have split it into multiple tasks right. Step by step workflow. Now let me know what do you think. How can we split this task into multiple steps? What would be the first step? We go to the website. Very good. So go to the website. That is your next. Next. Next what should we do? Create the data from the websites. Yes. Then probably as chatjipit to give a summary. Yes. Chatjipit will give the summary. Then how? So maybe add to Google Docs for a sheet. Yeah, Google sheet. We can connect Google Docs. We can connect or if you directly want to send it as a Gmail. Main also that should be fine right. Something. Some end user application. Great. So these are the three steps that we are going to do. First is step is go to the company's webpage using that particular URL and get the data. Then summarize the information. Then mail or document the summary. These are the three steps involved in the simple process. Clear of these steps. Because if it is clear we will map this exact step to the modules. So why do you get why this listing down to step is very important is that even when you are working on your own use case for the competition. Just please list down at step by step. And for every step just map the module like this. For every step. For example, here in this workflow. First step is going to companies webpage using URL right. So HTTP will give you that. Okay. Next is we will talk about all these modules in detail. Now just understand for every step we have to map a module that is available in make. That is it. First going to companies webpage using the URL and getting the data that is using HTTP. Then summarizing the information our best friend chat GPT. Then step three is to mail or document the summary. Now we are using Gmail because we want it as a mail. If you want to want it to be document then you can add a Google doc there. You can add a Google sheet there whatever we want we can. Clear with this step and then mapping the module because this is approach that we have to follow. Okay. Now let's go step by step because these modules are new to you right. So let's see what is inside every module. Then we can go ahead and you know do the scenario. Now first there is a module head to TPP. Now we have to request now just don't um complicate anything. We are requesting the URL and we are going to get the data. So we to request to the URL where we want to go that field is available here. See if you add this module you remember there was a place and then popular circle inside make. If you click on that list of modules will be available. So in that you are going to select that particular module named as HTTP. So if you click on this head to TPP this window will open. In this window this is a window where we configure the head to TPP module. What is configuration? How we want this module to perform. So the same module can perform in different ways. You know based on your tasks the inputs vary right. For example calculator performs addition but if you give 2 and 3 as input it will give 5 as output. If you give 3 and 5 as input it will give 8 as output for addition right. Similarly however our inputs vary the output also vary. So we have to provide the proper input that we want inside this configuration of the modules. Okay now for HTTP we have to go to the URL. So we are giving the URL whatever URL you want you can give it here. Now there are certain methods. Don't complicate anything. So we have to interrupt but not getting this page. What I get to see is HTTP then actions get a file. We come back up. Yes. I will come to that. Just look into this screen. We will get to that sometime later. So selecting that see here. HTTP make a request right. So when you click on this one there are multiple actions available. I will talk about that sometime. Just understand. Like for every module we have to give input the input we need to configure it. So now there are multiple methods. Don't confuse anything. Right now what do we want? We want to get the data from the URL right. So that is why we get we use this method get. There are multiple other things available. So depending upon your use case like you want to send some message to the particular URL that is a different method. Now we want to get the data so we are using the get method. So let's like start very simple. So let's understand only this one. Okay. Now there are certain other things as well. So when you are doing this let's discuss about these aspects. Now after giving these kind of inputs there is a button save here. So if you click on save that particular module gets saved. So this is how we work on configuration of every module. Okay. Now just understand this one. Chaghipati is the next module right. Here we have to establish our connection with chatGPati. Right. So here once you click on this. Yeah. Kathika just one quick question. So before you begin with the second part of it. You mentioned that if I have to create a view summary of what's being offered by a particular organization. What if I have to compare it as you discussed earlier. Are we going to use multiple URLs or we will have to do it individually. Like you mentioned right. We could compare like if there are three companies. And what are being offered by these three companies in terms of courses. So in the URL bit that you were explaining earlier on the HTTPS. Are we just going to put one URL or we're going to use some abstraction like a comma or something and put different URLs together. How does that work? Yeah. Right now in the first scenario we'll start with only one URL. So you understand the dynamics behind how it works. Now then finally we are going to create an AI agent that will collect the names of multiple URLs or multiple competitors of IK and then it's going to do a comparative analysis for your incentive email. Okay. We'll post it by the end of the diagram. And to understand the dynamics we are starting with the simple use case. Okay. Now if you click on this one like coming to the next one. See right now I wanted to focus on these things because these things are very, very basic things which will help you when you enter into make environment and start creating the scenarios. So when you discuss this and then directly go there and then create it. I will also share my screen. I'll create this scenario. You can also step by step do along with it. Okay. That's how we are going to do. It's not that you are going to do. We are going to do this together. So don't worry about anything. Now click on this create a connection and here. This is an open AI connection because here whatever name you want you can just give. It's just a name for our connection. Then you have to paste your API key. Don't worry. We will share an API key with you. That's like a paid version of, you know, chargey pity. So that that gives better responses. So you can use that here and then click on same so that your connection gets established. Now what is an API key and how do I create it? Have you ever created an API key and have you used it? Let me know what is the purpose of an API key. Who connect connect the modules? Connect the modules. It's better. Even without make be regularly, you know, talk about API keys right. Have you ever used it anywhere? Anywhere else? Yes. I think I used it here. It's from the last that I remembered. One of the calling tools that we have right that has to be indicated with a code for or fresh test. I don't want to remember exactly. So yeah. So Hubsort is a different application right? And then fresh test is a different application for those two applications to connect to each other. We need some sort of secret key. How will fresh test know that okay, this Hubsort is only connecting with me? Is this a friend of mine or no? So something like that. That is why it's called an API key. It's a secret password that lets one app to talk safely to another apps data or services. Right now, just think about this opening. If there is no API key, how will we establish our connection? How will a chatGPT know that if some query from makes module, makes chatGPT module, it goes there? How will it understand that okay, this is this user only using through make they are raising a request? How will it understand? So we have some secret key, like code words kind of thing, huh? We essentially it's getting popular like kids not getting kidnapped, we use a, usually they say no, have a code word with them, just tell them the code words so that they can understand that this is not a stranger, something like that. So this API key helps any two applications to understand each other and trust that these are not strangers. So somebody whom I trust is sending me a request through this, some other different application let me do this. So that is, you know, passport kind of thing. Now how to create one, you should know how to create an API key, that's why, you know, this is essential, but right now don't worry about it, we will give you a secret key. So you have to go into the open AI, API key and create a new secret key and your key will get generated. So it will be looking something like this, you know? And then you just create a secret key and then you copy and use it anywhere you want. This is how we create an, create an open AI's API key and then use it anywhere. This is not only for why I'm mentioning this here is that for open AI we are now giving you a key. For example, you know, in your use case you might want to generate an image, poster or, you know, marketing, campaign automating, those things and then you want to create some visual image. And for that you might be using Gemini's module. There you have to create an open AI is, I mean sorry, not open AI. Gemini's API key, right? So anywhere the process of creating a using will be the same thing and also the configuration will also be the same thing. Any way, whenever you are using an LLL, the API key will be asked, please create and give in this way. Okay. For today's class, we will give you one. So once you establish the connection, this kind of screen will get opened. There you can select the model and also the prompt type. Like a, what kind of prompt you're giving text prompt, you should maybe give. And you have to, you can, sorry, sorry, sorry for the less. You know, you can type your prompt here. We have to have seen a lot of good ways of prompting in the previous class. So you can type your prompt here on what the action has to exactly be. Now, any, any doubts here, you know, in this one we had two steps. One is first setting up the connection by giving the API key. Once you set up the connection, you get this screen where you select the model prompt, prompt type and then give the prompt. That's it. Okay. Just check here, create a model response. All these things we will see later on. Then third step is any doubt. So for shall we move on to the third one? Correct. Correct. Cartagov. Can you please go back to the previous slide? Yeah. The model, which we get to see here, this will be the one, which I'm using with the email ID, which I've used for logging into make is it. Or it could be in the one. Yeah. So for example, under mining, the sensitivity access, that is the free one, right? So which will whatever access. So that is the one, it should be there or we can precisely choose that. This is the model I want to work on. We can choose it because now with the paid version of API key, as you will be getting access to multiple other models also. Like for example, GPT-5-wall, so like it's a thinking model. You know, if you have very complex tasks, for simple tasks like this, like getting going to the URL, taking the summary and summarizing the data, any model would do. But if you're performing some complex tasks, it has to decide on its own, right? Dynamic lead has to take some decisions for all those things, or you know, it has to be very creative. It has to think before it has to answer. Then you can go for thinking model. But it's depending upon the API key, you will get a list of models here. All these things we will see when we are working on this one step. Understood. Yeah. Any other queries, guys? If one can just show me the step one as well, Cardiah, the previous to previous slide. So this is first step, actually. Okay. Yeah. If having a query here? No. I just want to reach out to all the things up. Perfectly. Okay. Then we are going to do this together. Don't worry. See, immediately when we enter into the make environment, it will be like little difficult for you to follow what I'm saying. And then, you know, the keys also, the fields, parameters, it will be very difficult. So that's why we are seeing, we are looking into, we are taking an interface to our first and then we are going there and we'll create the, you know, workflow. Now, Gmail in third step is Gmail. We are going to select, send an email because we are going to send an email. To send an email, there has to be a from address and then to address it. So how will it know that we have to send from this ID? So we have to create a connection. Like we did for open air. So any module where some kind of authentication is required. It always asks for a connection. Otherwise directly like HTTP to open. If some authentication is required, some login is required. Definitely it will show create a connection. Okay. Sign in using your Google credentials here. That's it. We are done. So once you sign in with your credentials, a screen like this, this window will open. This is the configuration window. So now the fram address will be your address with which you have signed in. Now two address we have to define right? So click on this address recipient. Whatever email address you want to give, you can give, you can give even multiple email address by clicking on plus plus. How many air worry want? You can do then the subject of the email here. The content of the email whatever we want to put. So we will be going to discuss what's going to be the content of everything. Don't worry. So the content goes here and then click on say then it gets saved. Now do you understand like, so see this till this step. I just want you to understand. We have to whatever use case we have picked up. We have to list that down into multiple steps. After listing that down into multiple steps. For every step, map a module which is available in make. Then in make you have to configure. This is called as input configuration. There will be different parameters which is related to that particular module. So whatever based on our task, we want to give those inputs we provide in that particular configuration screen. That which understanding do you have so far? Yes. Now I just want you to answer. How will one module connect with something? For example, HTTP will take the data from the URL. Then how will chat repeat? Know that that is the data. So I have to use that particular data. Then even if it gets chat, we will give a summary. So how will Gmail take the summary and send an email? Have you thought about it while doing this one? My understanding was already connected. Since we are using the same platform. We are going one module after another using the same login. So that's my assumption. I'm sensing that there were two separate. We are thinking Gmail with chatGPT. And since we are using API integration, it should be able to capture details of that Gmail account as well. So it should be able to pick it up from there. Any other guesses? That's a nice guess. That's interesting. But do you remember? I told one example, right? It will drop the TV down. If you are not telling anything explicitly. That is the problem of AI. We have to why we have to learn AI is because we have to give it step by step instructions. So we have to explicitly mention what data is going to come from where. So that is called as data flow across the modules. So how will I make use of the URL data collected by HSTP, HSTTP module, inside chatGPT module so that it produces the summary. And chatGPT will produce the summary. I have to use that in Gmail module. So that is quite a connection that you mentioned earlier on the previous module that we were creating for Gmail. So we are restricting all the HSTTPs related data that we are fetching. And the way chatGPT is going to create the response, it should be limited. Or we're limiting the Gmail account only to the one which is connected with chatGPT. I think it was on the last page that you mentioned connections. Yes. So I'll tell you. Like we are using only the particular data. It will generate a lot of things. There are so much of information that's available. But we are going to take only the data that we require. And we are going to use this in the next next modules. Okay. This is how we are playing. This will be attention here. So this is a module right? HSTTP module. So if we are right click on this particular module, you will get something like this. See, you're giving a configuration. You're giving the URL. Even anywhere, you know, we have to run. So we have to execute. You have to make this perform the task right. When it becomes line only when you execute until then, the configuration will be available. The configuration whatever you have given gets saved. But it will not have executed the task. So when it will execute the task, if you right click on this one and select run this module only. Okay. When you do this, see this module and see this one. What is the difference? Can you see the difference here and this one? After execution. The tick mark with the double tick with the one. Double tick with one right. So this indicates that success fully. It has executed. One step because we have given only one step. So it has executed that one step success fully. This indicates that. So now, if you click on this double check one, you will see this kind of screen. So what it says here, there is an input and output. Input as a bundle, output as a bundle. We have input and output data bundles. Now I'm just repeating. For every module, if you're right click on the module, so many options will come. So if you run this module, only this particular module will get executed. Whatever input we have given, it will take that input. It will perform the action as per your description. And then it will produce an output. So how will we understand that an output is produced by checking this check mark. Okay. If you click on this one, you get something like this. Input and output data bundles. So now, what is a bundle in make? That will be the patient, right? So any doubts so far, we are entering into certain, you know, technical aspects. So you just want to make sure you're clear so far. We'll do this step once again, right? I think a wide way of understanding is the same. This is just for, you know, understanding so that, you know, becomes easy for you while doing the steps. Just understanding, the theoretical concepts that, while doing practical at TV varies. But any theoretical understanding you have any queries? No, no, fine, great. So stop me whenever you have any queries because, you know, we'll clarify that one, don't take up your queries till the end. Okay. Now what is a bundle in make? It's a package of data that flows, see from one module we were discussing that, we have to make the data flow from one module to another, right? So how will we do? For example, in Nicarve, we are ordering something. I'm ordering one item number one item number two item number three, all these things are packed as a bundle. And then I receive one, one big package. So inside that package, I have multiple smallest, smaller items, right? The same way bundles work. So it's like smaller, smaller items, whatever you get as an output. All these will be packed together and that is called as a bundle. So input bundle and output bundle. Whatever we want, we can open that bundle and pick up whatever we want. Okay. That is a bundle. So now see, this is how an input and output bundles look like. Can you see here? It's easy for us to get highlight to this particular section. That's why we are seeing this on the slides. So it becomes easy when we go there. And there also don't worry, we rest assured, we will go step by step. I'll do one and I'll give you time for you to replicate the same thing. So we'll complete this and I'll see here in the input bundle. What is the input basically for the HTTP module? The URL we are giving is the input, right? It has to take that as an input. Correct. Right. And output. What is the output? The summary of the URL, I mean the website. The content of the URL. The summary is going to be done by chat, the content. Yeah. So how will the website content be? It's an HTML, right? So that HTML page. Okay, this is how our web page is already in Kim. This is indication. If it's an image, it's mentioned as IMG. This is something like the don't don't or think of anything because this task is done by AI. We need not worry about this thing. Just understand. This is the input. That is the URL and the data obtained that the website content is available here in the output. That's what we have to think. Now what we have to do? The HTML module, HTML module to a label. So HTTP module to chat, G pity module. We have to send the data, right? Now how will we do that? We have seen this configuration page. Do you remember open AI's configuration page? Yes. Okay, let's establish the connection. We'll give the model. You'll give the prompt and I also mentioned that whatever prompt we want to give, we can give here. Once you click on this prompt section, immediately on the left-hand side, you will get a window like this one. Okay. What is this one? This is the input and output of HTTP module. If you see here data, the HTML page that we have checked, right? So that is listed here. So we want to take this input. The chatjipati has to take this HTML pages input and it has to summarize it, right? That is our task. So you give the prompt, but the data from previous module from here, you just click on and this data will directly come here. So all these things we will see here, but just understand, when you click on an input field of one module, and you want to, the output of the previous module will get open. See, understand this one, which will analyze this one. Output of HTTP module should go inside the input of chatjipati. Chatjipati's output should go as input of Gmail module, right? For every module, input will be previous modules output. Only then it becomes a sequential process, isn't it? Or you clear with that? For every module, we have to give the previous module output as the input. So how are we going to give that? If you click on the input field, the output field of the previous module will get open from there, you just select whatever output you want. If there are multiple outputs, all multiple outputs also will be displayed here. You can select whatever you want. So for clear, just you have to understand what we want now. Other things we will take care while doing the, in our scenario, you have to understand two things basically. Every module input will be the output of the previous module. Then how to take the output of the previous module? If you click on that input field, let's say automatically this kind of window will open. That will give you all the outputs of all the previous modules. So you can pick whatever data you want. Okay. Any queries so far? Just go back to the previous. You can, no. No, the one that you're showing. You're an expediental summarizer. You get, why is the run? This is the problem. Okay. So this two has nothing to do with anything. It's just a form. There's, there's two. No, this is two is nothing. Here it is mentioned as data rate. Can you see HDTP two? Okay. Something, no, it, it takes up that number. Oh, okay. It actually changes. Don't worry about those things. We have to just refer to only the field. Automatically this number, this reference, all those things will be taken care by make itself. Okay. Okay. Now, what do you think will be the input of this GPT model and what will be the output of GPT model? For HDTP, input was input URL. Right. And then the output was the page that they are content of that particular URL. That will be the input for GPT model. And output would be summarizing it. Which is the problem that we're taking. Yes, exactly. So input is a prompt, right? Inside the prompt, we have given that particular data also. So the prompt is basically the input. And then the result will be the summary. Can you see here the output? What we have given is a prompt. Do you remember, you are an expert, you are a summarizer that data we have given as input. But if you see the output, it's in plain text, right? It's a summary. So it has done the summary. And this one, what you have to do is this is the name of result, right? So that result will come as the input. That is in the mind main and just you're going to use this as a content. That's it. Okay. We will just do this step by step. Just understand that prompt is the input for TATGPT model. And taking that prompt, whatever data you want to pass in, you're giving it inside the prompt itself. And then the result is the summary. And that summary will just click on here as the male's body content. Then it will automatically send a male. Okay. This is how our workflow looks like. Okay. If we right click on this particular module, this double check mark will come that it has executed. But once you connect multiple modules, and if you want the entire scenario to be run like for example, you want to take the data, I want to run it. I mean, I want to give it a check the data from the particular URL. I want to give it a chargey pity. Summarize it and then GMA. There is a button here, run once. If you click on run once, this entire scenario, sequential steps, all three steps will get executed. And see here, this is a save button. Make does not do auto save. So it's always you know, good practice to save your scenario before running. And if you run like if you get some errors in between right, see if you want to check the errors, here is the logs where we can check the errors. Just for you to understand these things. Now let's all start creating this scenario. Let me go into the screen. Okay. Let me share this particular screen. So you all can enter into the mix, make one and then create a scenario, create a new scenario. I'm also coming. Okay. Can you see my screen guys? The make. Yes. Okay. Now let's click on create scenario. I'll do one module and then you can also replicate the same thing. Once we complete that, you know, we can go step by step like that. So it becomes you same. Now I've clicked on the plus creates scenario. We can rename our scenario like this. Okay. Now let's click on plus. See if you see here what is our first module headstit. See if you click on headstit. There are multiple actions. See headstit. B is a module that is capable of performing multiple actions. For example, if Gmail is a module, it can send a mail. It can reply to a mail. It can search for your mail. There are multiple actions that you can do with the help of one particular module. All these things are listed here with a description. Just when you are creating your own use case, sometime you just give a thought. You just understand this one. Go through the description. Understand what all capabilities a module could do. That will also give you an idea to refine your use case is better. And then how to efficiently use the modules and finally complete the task. Now we want to just get a data rate. We want to make a request. All ways whenever you are requesting that you are a loop, please send me the data. So something like that. So we are making a request. So click on make a request. Okay. So when you click on make a request, automatically these screen, whatever we discussed, that gets open. Now here you just type your URL. Okay. The method. As we have discussed, there are multiple methods. Don't worry about anything. We are just going to get the data from this URL. So we select this get method. Now body type. So it can be any type of data that it gives. So I'm just giving raw. Even without these, you can execute. Maybe we can check that also. Maybe let me leave this as empty. Now there is an option. Pass response. So always it's preferable to choose this as S. Even if you choose no you will get a response definitely. But sometimes you know some data will be in different format. It has to handle all these things. So we are asking. Make to handle everything on your own. Say if you know whatever, however, whatever format the data is, you just handle it on your own. We are just giving this and giving us see. That's it. Now right click. Run this module only. So this indicates that the module is running. So once the module runs, we get something like this. See here. This is an input bundle and this is the output bundle. So if you click on this place, this bundle gets expand. This bundle expands. And then you can see the query URL here. And if you go into output data, you see the HTML page here. Okay. Any doubts? No. Can you please do it yourself? Then I'll be. Done. Done. Everyone. Anyone else on the left? Step one. Okay. So if not let's move on to the next step. Now we have to connect one module to another. Right? So this is something if you just move your cursor here, you can add another module. So what is our next module? It is open AI. Right? Now what do we want open AI to do? See here. This is what I said. Just explore the modules. It can generate a response. You know, it can get a response. Delete a conversation. Then you know complete the prompt or something like that. You know, upload a file. Generate a video also. It can do. And generate images using Dali. So all these things. Depending upon your scenario, whatever action you want to perform, you can choose this. Now we want. We are going to give a prompt. And this opening I has to generate a response. So let's select this. Okay. Now I've already established a connection. So this screen gets open. Now. So it interrupt. Just get a response and generate a response. Why is the same thing? No. I'm getting to see. There is a response already generated by chat. See, but you go and get that particular response. So that is getting a response. Generating a response is you are giving a prompt. And then for that particular prompt, we want a response to be generated by chat. Okay. Okay. Okay. We can unlink this module also. Yes, we can do. We have to be directly corrected. If I have done something wrong, then if I have to touch it. You can right click and then delete a module also. Okay. Okay. Now. Is your open AI key document shared? No. Okay. Okay. Will then can you please share it in the chat? Please enter into the document. Pick up any key. If your if a key is available against your name, please use that key. And if you are there is no key map to your name, just use any key. Sorry, where you need to see on the on the API key, Karteka? Yes. Would I please share one key here in the chat? So for easy reference, they can use that key also. Okay. This establish a connection by giving the, you know, open AI is API key. And let me know once you are done. It's asking for organization ID after API key. Yes, not a, that's not a mandatory payment on the run. So I can click on save the firmware and save. Okay. Okay. After open it. So always in modules, guys, this is a very good point. The mandatory fields will be marked with an asterisk. So concentrate only on that. When you're initially creating your cases. So just explore the other aspects as well. But always don't forget to give the mandatory thing. And mandatory thing is so very important. Other things are, you know, enhancing your input or finding your input further. So something like that. So Karthika once I added the API and went on save, it's asking for a response ID. On the next page. Response ID which which, you know, which action have you chosen? Is it generated response? Get a response. Ah, so get a response because get a response is different from generated response. Get a response means already there is a response available in chat GPT window. You have to give that particular ID. We get some chat GPT links and all you remember. You know, test that particular ID we have to give. And we have to say get a response already that is available from there. So it's like similar to exploring your past history chat history. Right now we want to generate a response. So what you do is right click on the particular module. Delete that particular module add a new module and give that action as general data response. Okay. Yep. Guys you are all done. Shall we go shall we proceed forward? Yeah. So I think we are now going to go back. Basically I mean to the previous step where we are entering the API key. Or do we have to delete the module? I'm asking this for a random. Oh, actually API key you need not give once the connection is established that shouldn't be a problem. If you want to if you're having one more API key you won't because you have exhausted your token amount and everything. No, exhausted your own then what you can do is you can give add and then you can add one more. Like by giving a different name. So in the drop down you will have multiple API connections. Okay. No. Yeah. So like anyone is still in API key phase or shall we move forward? Okay. I'm just taking that as a positive sign and let's move forward. We are going to choose a model. So whatever model we want we can choose. See, as this is the you know the paid key we are using. So all these things will be listed. We can just you know for this one we don't require a very sophisticated model. We can select a simple model also fast and cost efficient model because it's just going to summarize it. Or if you want GPT 5 mini also we can now this is we are going to give a text prompt because we are not going to we are going to generate text early right. So for that now we can give a prompt you know how to like as I told you before. Once you click on the input field of this particular the any module the output of the previous module opens like this. So from here if you see this data if you click on this one it will come here. So let's give a prompt. Okay. You are an expert. You are a summarizer. Please take. What is the input this data I'm just clicking this one data as input. And. Samarize. This information into. Plain text. Okay just simple whatever you want you can give I'm just giving a very simple prompt we can refine this also. For like a complex you can define or even if you want to give a very good prompt you go ahead and give. Just I'm going to save this particular model. See here always it's a good practice to save and then once. Multiple modules are connected from the beginning we want because the data has to flow from here to here right. So always it's a good practice to do run once. So see it's running. This module get has completed its execution. Now this module is executing this is indicated by this progress. But I think first I need to individually run that module. Not required. Sometimes it will not run because. When there is a data flow across modules no you will get a response like it's it's it's a box where it will ask you for particular data. So just close that. So because the and the run option no the one which you clicked on right it's not allowing me I'm getting a. So what do we call. I'm basically I'm not able to do that. It's not allowing me to run the option. Okay let us check one second. So like see here the output input is the prompt. What we have given just I want you guys to observe only this one just check this screen once if you are in your makes screen. This come back here. See what we have embedded that data output of the previous module here right. So it went inside your prompt can you sense that your next port you are also summarizes the one that we have given please take. After that we have given that data right. So instead of data the entire output data has been replaced by that particular video. Okay. And then there is a if you see here this is something which is not coming. For me and maybe I'll I'll allow you to share your screen so let's do that. So I'll be complete this Gmail and then go ahead or anyone else is facing any problem with this module. I just had one question. We ran the same thing. In fact the URL was same and pretty much the prompt response that I shared was the same thing that you copied. When we see the credit used amount it says the overall usage or the whole thing was around 9.1 KV or something. For you while it is 2.7 KV for me, why is that you are doing the same thing right same activity. Here on just in front of operation one right. Why does it say so much for you like I know it's very small though, but why is it 9.8 for you and 1. something for me. We did the same thing. Okay. Same model jpg 5 mini we are using same prompt also we are giving same URL from where we are fetching from. It's not that is why it's not deterministic right even the output response. For example for me it would have generated a big summary for you it would have generated a small summary. So it depends upon how much data we are putting in and then how much data it's giving out. Every time it would change like for example let me run this again let's see this. Okay. Every time it changes. So that's why you know AI2 is there not they don't give deterministic response even while using. Chargipity would have observed for the same thing if you ask the same question every time it will give you a different response right. It will not give you the same response. Okay. Well I think the reason is in your output it was able to synthesize the entire thing and for me it says that the URL it was not able to fetch it. So if I'm trying to do a run over here run this module only. When I go to that section right after it just processes it I think I'm not using the correct website. I did India website I think I'll have to change that. Okay. Okay. No problem. See here it what I want to convey here is whatever you have observed is right if the if the output is you know gives a correct URL or something like that then it will be very less but still you know for us like last year it was 9.0 and it's 7.3. So I'm just going to determine is like in that. Yeah. That way. Okay. Now. I'm just one new face of problem right. Who face the problem? It was one. Yeah. Can you please share your screen like I'm coming to this. I'm coming to this. I'm going to. Anyone else having any problem or you have completed these two steps. Can you please I should I replace the current share. Yeah. You can replace. I'll share back again. So I just took a is my screen visible. Was it? No. Yes. Yeah. It's visible. Okay. No. No. Yeah. Just here there is a pop-up box run once. Click on that. Yeah. So the HTTP one. We have run. No. No. Don't run like that. Then. Jin come down. Can you see the pop-up box. Okay. Okay. This one. So this is how I was saying see I don't get the option of running it. So you're unable to click this one. Yes. Yes. Click on save. Okay. Just go into the open AI module. Click on that. Just save save save save. I did not use the high key. We said just random website. That is fine. Just going to HTTP once. Any URL you can take. Click on that. Okay. No problem. Save. Just click on HTTP. Run once. Okay. From below I'm not able to go here from here I can. Individually the module I can run. Not both the modules. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. You go to run once. Let's check whether it is enabled now. No. Click on this down arrow. Can you open. Okay. See. What is this? Okay. Just can you. Can you. No. No. No. No. No. No. Why is it? Shall I change the URL to ours? It shouldn't be a problem like it's like. Go to your logs. Let us check once. This logs. logs. The last one. Check. Check list kind of thing. Last last. Maybe change the URL and let's check because it's in my view. Let's check once. Save. Check. Check once. To run that particular URL. Or you just go to our news scenario and do. If... Sometimes you know, you're getting into, just don't do anything. Just open a news scenario and try. So, I need to go back or... Yeah, go to scenarios. Save changes. Save changes. Save changes. Just go. Create. Now repeat the steps. Head should be. Head should be. Get up. Come down. Make a request. Yeah. Get there, you are. You have copied, I think. Okay. Now run. Run once. Okay. I need to go to this. Oh, yeah. So now run once. It's a... Come down. Come down. Yeah. Oh, so. Now let me share my screen. Okay. Now we have to connect the Gmail module. So click on this one. Go to Gmail. Then we have to send an email, right? So send an email. You know, just establish your connection here. Can you do that? I'll be waiting for the next steps. Have you all connected your Gmail account in using this module? Well, I'm stuck with this one. I'm not getting the data after running it on open API. I have a second step. Okay. Yeah. I've given a prompt, but it's not giving me a result when I'm trying to run. It's just error with the URL. I'll try to make it once again. Oh, yeah. Error with the URL and the sense then just try changing the URL. I've already done that. Okay. Then save and then run once. Right. I did. Let's see. Okay. Okay. Okay. So in the mean file, can you please open a new scenario and do sometimes you know, it remembers certain things and then because of a certain RPG direction, it might cause a problem. So we did for Ashman, right? Same thing. Please go to the news scenario. Guys, one, have you established the connection if you have done with this steps? Yes. Then go to two, add recipient. You can give your ID also. So as we mentioned, whenever there is an input field, once you click on the input field or the output of all previous, you know, modules, we get displayed here. See, for example, HTTP modules or put also you can see and then open AI's output also you can see. So right now we don't want anything else right? We want just the mail ID. Can you tell me a few of your mail IDs so we can check that out also? Can you drop a few email ID of yours in the chat? So let me pick that. Anurah, good. It looks good. Okay, now Anurah, I'm adding one more recipient. So, let's take it into a quick start. So now I'm adding Pratik, so ID also. Okay, I'm sending mail to both. Now subject. So let us give us you are all somebody, anything. See, you can give anything. See, just observe this one for a while. Can you see here? There is a result and file data file name both contains same data. Here's a concise expert summary of the page. Like whatever chat you put in has even that output. Then conversation ID, then something, something response ID, then do you remember when you get response? You got some response ID right? If you are generating using this module to generate a response like this. And you again want to take this output and want the chat GPT to perform something else. Then you can use that get response module and give this response ID. I hope now it makes sense. Is it clear? Someone asked that out right? Is it clear for you? Right, the difference between generate response and get response. Yes. So now we can, in get response, we can use this response ID. And take this output directly. Okay? Now, if you see here created at right. So let me use that in subject. So it will give me your summary and this particular data and timing. So simply, just we can use any fields anywhere to show that and just using. Now the body time, it's a raw HTML and see why we are using raw HTML is that. So right now, don't have content as text, images, bundles together different. So we have some kind of output. So in those cases, when you don't have some structured output, this is that text. This is a image, something like that. You just go for raw HTML format. And what is a content? So result, file data is the content. Right? So if you click on this one automatically gets displayed here. Then you just save this one. Save the entire scenario. Then run once. Now first module is running. Done. Second module is summarizing. Let's wait for some time. Meanwhile, you can also try in the image. It content, we will use the result file name. Right? Yes. And then we'll click on save. See, then you just run once. Okay. Now it has generated a response. If you see here, my subject is URL summary. The timing in which it is generated in output. So it has sent the main. Now Pratik and Anurak can confirm whether they got the main. Okay. Kalthika, I got an error on Gmail. Let's say request had insufficient authentication scope. 403 runtime error. Okay. Can you please share your screen. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I received it. Okay. So this will happen when. Can you run once. Because instead of doing module by module operation, sometimes if we do that, it happens. Let's check. Okay. Can you please click on the Gmail module. Let me check that once. So this is output. Click on that module itself. Come down. Content. Content. Click on this. Just give this result file data. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Now, let's check what is the previous error. Log the last checklist and purple. Note. Open log. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Mm. That's a correction error category. Okay. I think correction. Yeah. Gmail. Can you please come out of that Gmail. Can you add a new connection. Maybe use your personal idea or something else? Okay. Sign in with Google. I think it is you can stop sharing also you want to give the credentials. Guys have you all completed this one did you all get the mail? Yes, got the mail. I did not. I mean, I don't know. I am in twice. I don't know if you know what I am going to do. Okay. Okay. Can you share your schedule or are you getting any error or something? No, I do not get any error. I mean, I am running it once again. It ran fine. But yet I did not get. I use the personal email ID. I did not get any. And now it's. Did you get a mail only on the mail? In the mail. No, no, the content is not there or the mail itself. You did not receive. I did not get the mail. Can you share your screen once and show them? Okay. I received it just now. Oh, great. So everyone, everyone received the mail. Right? Shall we move on to the next one? So, hi, Katika. I tried sending it out to Manuraj. But he has received the mail, but there is no content on it. Okay. Can you be share your screen? Let's take. Karthika. Karthika. The I did not get it. No, no. No, no. Sorry, I am sure. It's an extremely. It's a Chevy manner. Can I present my screen? Yeah, yeah. That, you know, it's like, say, we have done a working prototype. We have to refine the prompt pattern better. So we get good response. Right. So just showing the ones because it looks like that it pulled the. I understand. Yeah, yeah. So initially when we when we are doing this, these kinds of things happen, just now to check the working prototype, we have given like the see, it's like. Hehtml, it's like a response. Now, we have to refine our, what is that prompt? Okay. Okay. I'll give you a sample prompt. Maybe it just gives me one moment. Let me take that and give it to you. You'll be just copy and paste that one. You have shared anything? No, no, I'm just entering. So in the slides, we'll be, we have shared all these slides. Also with you in app level, it's available. So in the slide, it's still few have the link to this one. Let me. Kusha, did you get the mail? No, it's showing the same error. Uh-huh. I actually, so from and two was the same email ID. I changed the two email ID, but I again was the same error. No, it shouldn't be a problem. From and two, if it's the same, ID also, it will work. Okay. Did I share, yeah, new scenario and then, okay. So something like, I'm just sharing a sample prompt. So we can refine that better and better. Okay. So whatever, whatever we are giving, you know, take the, see, this is the input data. Okay. I'm just putting in square brackets that input data. There we have to attach that particular thing. So this is one, one, this one. Please share your screen like, someone was not listening. Should I share? Yeah, yeah, please go ahead. Who's screen is shared? No one's right. Yeah, please go ahead. Yeah. So I shared it with Manuraj, it interesting to content, but he has received an email. Yeah. Just open Gmail module. Click on that. Okay. Come down. You are a summary. Body type select that as a raw. Because, or come down content in content, we have to give the content only then we'll receive. So here's file, result file data. Give that as content. Click on the version file data, not name file data. Okay. Now click on now save. Add your recipient address also. It's, it, you can send from your ID. You can receive from your, or receive to your ID as well. Like add recipient. Save. Hmm. Now, run once. Angshman, did you try the new prompt? I'm trying. I'm, I'm just saying. Kushal, you're, can you try a new scenario? Let's try. Yeah, in this, try. Okay. I think, um, okay. One thing in the, in the, in the Gmail content, I have used just the result, not the file name and all. Does that make a difference? No, no, no, just refresh. Ah, no, put. No, no, no, not an issue. Uh, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, right. There are file names to drop down. So we just saw, no, pull, we're showing. Uh, below result, there was file name file name 2 line. So I just selected result as the, uh, so you have. Yeah, I bought this. You got it. Uh, but we can't see, uh, uh, file data. You have to select. It's not result. That is why it's giving you a lot of things. File data. Oh, okay. Um, inside result, you have file data. I have. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah. Now, it should work. Mm-hmm. It will work. Now let's start this. Got it, right? Great. Uh, okay. So this is what, uh, he also, like, refine. We have to, we can refine the prompt. So, so this is not because of the Gmail module. Whatever, chatGPT has given as output. That particular thing is sent via mail. Now, what we have to do is, we have to first see these kind of things happen. Um, this is the best way to learn olds. Now, we are getting this response. This is not as expected. So, which module we have to refine? We have to go to chatGPT module, refine our prompt to get a better response. That's it. Okay. So we'll work on that also. Like, our next exercise also is a part of doing this. Okay. So don't worry. So we'll go ahead with agents. We'll create agent. Right now, what you have done is every single step. You explained to this, uh, module to do, right? But now, the heavy lifting will be done by AI agent itself. Shall we try doing that? Okay. Yes. Anyone, uh, let's try. Did anyone receive, uh, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, Did anyone receive? Let me, let me, show you. I would actually want to see how we could look. Yeah. I'll, I'll show you. Just trying to run that with the new, uh, Prom that was shared. So it's still running. Okay. Uh, just, uh, put the new new Prom to see every time it will give a different response. Uh, I'll show you. Actually, what, what it is summarizing is pretty much the HTML, uh, HTML. It is summarizing, right? It is not reading the, the, the, the, the, it's out there. It is reading the code. Yes. No, no, it, see, can you see my screen? All right. So for that, from it has given a response like this. See, you could see multiple things like this. Um, so once I've got a response like this. Pants, I got a response like this. Okay. Something like this. Then I, uh, went, uh, went again and, um, that's a charity party. I modified that. Don't give it as mark down because these things are marked down. Simple right. Give it as plain text only. Uh, see here. Once I gave that, it has given a response. Can you see here? Like this has happened in the first session. I have sent to azitha kajol deep the pile. There is points. Why is it so that? For non-operative, it's coming up. I mean, we definitely, we definitely did some with this. Okay. So see, I'll show my screen and here I'll, okay. I'll give you a prompt. Just try this prompt. Then maybe we'll take two minutes more. Not an issue. We'll try this. Uh, then we will go to the next one. Um, see, there is a solution document link here. Can you see this URL summarizer document? We just. Hmm. Can you give this one? Just begin to refine this further and further. It just take, see, uh, there is a refinement technique. We have learned in our previous prompt engineering session, right? Just you take this prompt. You do explain it to chat GPT give us a ask it to refine. Then you get a refined prompt. Then use it here. Just do all these experiments after the session once. But right now, you can try this one. So for two minutes, we'll try this one and then, um, because you ask for a hot stop at 10, there just want to complete agents also. I am also meanwhile trying to do. And, how are you trying this one? Yeah, yes, that thing. You can't do that. Did you get the response function? In plain thing. I'm running the module. Okay. It's from. Okay. At least the summary should be there. Um, I hope you're all able to see my screen right now. No, Karthika, I was the same response as before. So can you try changing the model? Sometimes you know it behaves for the model also like this. Going to chat GPT. Go for GPT 5. I think we will use GPT 5 from mini. Just go for normal GPT 5. The one that is mentioned is systems. GPT 5. Yeah. Systems. Yes. Yeah. It's going to be a response. It's going to be a similar. Okay. We'll be right. Can you please wait till the end of the session like for tumours? Yeah. Yeah. Oh. In the meantime, I'm trying this one. I'm just, you know, let's, let's complete a few more things. I got to repind and serve this time. Or better one. But if you're, yeah, now we have to go with the prompt. We have to like now we are getting the content of the this one right. But it will be in star star format. No, not in star format. I'll just show you once if you're. Yeah. We see my screen. I'm just entering this cave once again. Ha ha. This is a good response. Only it is not giving you see. You can tell me give it as five bullet pointers. Yeah. I was thinking that we can use it for the last previously. It was taking out the, I mean, the, even the code and everything right. Yeah. So just refine the prompt better. Give me the output in five bullet pointers. Okay. Then it will, like it's always, you know, how well we refine the prompts for first. Just don't go with refining, refine the prompts in the first attempt itself. Just get the running prototype ready first. Wherever you're working on a new use case, then try go and then refine your output and bring to the form that, you know, you expected to be. Okay. Okay. Yeah. You can, yeah. You can work with your screen up. Okay. Now, can you see this one? Like, have you noticed? Nobody has asked this one. Why have you asked? This, what is this symbol standing for? Maybe in what time I have to keep it running. Yes. Actually, when we have to run. So this is very, very important thing in, uh, uh, make actually automation scenarios. It's a trigger. Your scenario has to start with something, right? There has to be some starting phase. You have to tell, okay, perform this task. Then it will not become an automation. You, when one leave any you ask with everything. Now we are doing for, we are checking our workflow because we are running once. Every time you shouldn't come and run this once, you have to set up something. Every day at 9 a.m. in the morning do this for me. Or whenever, uh, check my Gmail, whenever I get a response, send a mail to me. So all these things automatically, you are adapting something and generating something. So that is trigger, okay? Uh, without a trigger, a scenario will not work. A scenario has to start with a trigger only. Okay. What's a trigger? It's a starting event that tells you scenario went to run. So there are the clock symbol at the start of the scenario. In which your module, let us know that is that trigger. It will be available in the first module. Triggers can be time-based as we discussed run this everyday at 9 a.m. Or it can be even based like in my Google sheet, when a new row is added, trigger this one. For example, for example, these will be helpful in finance things or, you know, every day if there is a dynamic sheet and if there is a row gets updated. Whenever a row gets updated, you want to get notified. For example, if there is a new sale and the two sale is getting automated in an automatic update in a particular sheet, whenever there is a new sale, you want that mail to come. Or you want to send a slack message to anyone. So something like this, the event based, these are even based triggers. So trigger in make is the starting event that tells your scenario when you have to run. Okay. Now we have seen all these things, the logs and everything. Now a few more tips before we start with agents. There is a purple color bulb symbol here. So this is like AI. If you want to improve this like for example, Anxiousment just try this one maybe after the class. You just give my output is not structured. I want it in a structured format. Can you please do this in the same scenario? Is it the purple curve plus sign using? No. Can you see here on my screen, the purple color AI beta version? So this will help you with the problem itself. Where will you tell the person? Where will you tell the person? This will be available in the paid version. Okay. Then introducing AI agents. Now we have dragged and dropped the modules. We mapped the data fields and then sometimes you've been drawn and you have to write the prompts on your own. You cannot improve everything on your own. So if this process can also be simplified it will be really helpful for us. And also someone asked in the beginning that, One year we are giving like this we are getting a data. But how will we do as some analysis? For example there are multiple competitors for IK. You have a list of competitors in some Google sheet. You want an AI agent or assistant to go to that Google sheet automatically. Take the names of those companies and go search about those particular companies. Find out how their competitors are. I can provide everything in some structure table kind of thing. Shall we do that? That's a different difficult process. Now when we talk about doing competitor analysis like this. What are the steps that comes to your mind? What are all the things we have to do? Initially we did that right. For a simple task we list down the steps. Then map the modules right. So now for doing a competitor analysis multiple multiple companies. So what are the steps do you think of? First thing is find all the competitor companies. Yeah. Come in. Come in. There you are else. Okay. Then. Compare the offerings. Or other first fetch the offerings and then compare. Which is all? So how many how many open AI modules will you use? Are you going to use one for every company? No, I should not be. And then for analysis how many open AI modules will be used? It has to collect all company data and one place. I mean, yeah. Ideally we would want everything to be one place. One module for enter doing the particular task. But so far now we have analyzed. Oh, Chad G. Pity module right. Is there an option to give multiple things to do analysis? I mean the first would be to input and get the output. Once we get the output of the data that we need. The next step if it were trying to synthesize or summarize it. We could use the output as an input and then ask for another output. Is what I assume. Yeah. That's a very good response. You know, I would want you to check the previous sessions video. Maybe whenever you have a time. It's like a lengthy process. For example, first I have to have a Google sheet. Having list of names of the competitors. Now I have to use the Google sheet module to get all the names. And then pass it all to Chad G. Pity module. I'll say for every row in the Google sheet. Do. Competitor analysis assuming that you are doing this as a PM or PA. Whatever your role is, is a part of interview kick start. Then it will understand the role context better and then provide a response. Now I have to combine all like where once it produces the response for every particular row every company it has to get logs somewhere. I have to document it either in the form of Google sheet itself or as a Google document. Now this is one process. Once for example, there are 10 competitors. I have to complete this entire process. After that, the document which contains the 10 companies data right. I have to give that as input to Chad G. Pity again. To do analysis, define that as a table and then give me the. Final May. Send me the mail in the format right. So this is a two two different scenarios you have to create and it's a lengthy process. Now instead of doing all these things, AI is going through the heavy lifting. You're just going to describe what you want to do. Agent itself takes care. Previously now whatever we have done so far is just workflow automation. Once you know what are the steps that you have to follow, you go for that. Then what is AI agent? It's like it will understand your request itself and it will perform everything on its own. So why do we want this? It's faster than that as well. Improved accuracy and consistency and it's like a personal assistant directly. That is fine. So how are we going to create agent? Again, we come to the dashboard. On the left-hand side, you can see AI agents here. And then I think you can apparently also start doing this AI agents. Then if you create like plus creates scenario, we have right. So here you can create an agent, click this to create an agent. You will get a window like this. So by default, you have makes AI provider connection. It's like open AI we have right. So make also provides its own AI provider connection. You can give a name for this agent. You can select the model. And then you can give some prompt for it. Okay. And then save it. You are like this. Similar to the open AI thing only. But when you're giving a prompt, you just give a simple prompt. Okay. In the, in the very version, I'll show you that maybe there is an automatic option to improvise your prompt. Or you can take help of chargey pity to refine the prompt. In the prompt engineering session, we have seen how to take a help of an LLM itself to refine your prompt. So make use of that method to refine your prompt, explaining the scenario what you want to do. And then once that is done, you get a screen like this. Okay. Now if you have some documents, for example, in Prosh, you remember custom GPTs. We added some documents, right. Similarly, if you want to add some documents to, you know, the, to improve the context of this one, just click on add and then give a simple document. And then give the documents also. Then tools. So we'll come to tools here. So what are tools? Right now, what we have done like, what do you think the tools will be? Just tell me for doing this competitor analysis, what kind of tools will an agent require? Okay. Okay. Let me know. What are the tools do you think? We have tools. We discussed in the beginning, right? I'm here referring to Google sheets and now. Yes. So what are all the things required? Google sheet, more doc. I mean, we'll talk maybe. So Google sheets be required for giving the names of the competitors. Then if you want to log in the data somewhere that document also, we might give or it can have it in its own memory that's up to us. Then if you want to send that mail, we want to give Gmail also as a tool. Right. So all these are tools. Okay. Just try when you're working on a use case, just think of what all the things tools we have to give and then give accordingly. Now the next step would be. Just a second. Is my screen passed or something? No, right. No, we can see the inside agent at more context page. Okay. Yeah. So, particular this page that you are showing, that would come after I have given the system prompt in the previous page. Yes. After giving system prompt and say, you will get this screen. So this is for, you know, adding or defining your, see, the system prompt whatever I'm giving, No, that will come here in the first one. So this is a different screenshot. So it does not correspond to our scenario. But I'm just saying system from whatever you're giving that will come here. I got the page. I got the page. I just put a random, any of this. I'll tell you what we have to give in tools right now. Now the right in page like just remember this as custom GPT. Whatever we have seen left inside what we'll do. We'll refine it step by step step by step. We'll refine and right side you can test your custom GPT right. Similarly, an agent also will refine left side by giving, you know, refining your system prompt one by one. Then right side this red box indicates where you can give some task. The same task. Whatever. Like for example, if there are multiple tasks, you can give a single task. Or then if you say that, you know, to do the competitor analysis and send me the mail, it will do that. It will automatically do that. Okay. Now we are going to test this. But before this, we have to add tools right. We were discussing. Just this is very important guys. Like if you listen to this one, you'll automatically you will be able to add all the tools by yourself. Just click on this create module. Even when I say now you can do that also. Like please create module. And click on this one. Then the tools can be either a module or a scenario. So we have created a scenario right. We can give even some scenarios as the tool for this particular agent. Or you can give a module also as an agent. For example, Google sheets, Gmail. Separately we can add modules also. But one thing that is very, very important here. And that helps us a lot is check this out. Check this pink box. For example, if I'm using a Google, Google sheet, I'm having the list of competitors. What action will I choose in that Google sheet? I'll say that there is an action like same. You remember send a mail and those are actions right. Generator response. Similarly for Google sheets, you can get the range values. That is you are getting the data from Google sheets. Because we want only the names of the competitors from our Google sheets. So we want to get the range. If we are doing that manually, we have to go to the Google sheet. Check a one till if F10. So from that data it has to analyze. Maybe this will be really helpful for Kushal and someone who is working on spreadsheets a lot. This is this agent. If you click on this let AI agent decide that, can you see this option here? That it's highlighted in pink color. Yes. This will suppose to see on your screen right? We are not going to, we would not be able to find this. Yeah, yeah. So it's on my screen. We'll do that. This one right pink color. If you click on that check box, the AI agent and to be automatically dynamically go to that particular sheet. It will understand, okay, I have to check this particular range. And then it will, you know, Or design this range to this range contains the data. So let me pick that. It will automatically fill all the data. That is required for the input configuration of a particular model. As simple as that. You have to just keep the module name. It will automatically decide. Only basic details we have to give name of the sheet. Only we have to give. Okay. We'll do this. Okay. Now we'll do. Okay. I just want you to check my screen. I'm just sharing a different screen. Okay. Just as I can. I'm sharing my screen. Where is this? Yeah. Can you see my screen? Yes. Yes. No. Just going, we are going into AI agents beta. So you can try this certain options will not be available in the unpaid version. I have also used the unpaid version to create multiple such agents. Right now I'm showing you the features of the paid agent. See, for example, explore this in your unpaid accounts only. But when you are working on the competition, you want something which is more advanced that will really help your use case to perform better. Definitely you just, inform us will do the need for. Okay. Right now going to AI agents create agent. Okay. Now here we can use anything. My open AI connection. My makes AI provider connection. Anything lets let's choose. So I'm just using my makes AI provider connection itself. Let me give a competitor analysis agent. Okay. Now let me select a model. There are three different models. Let me select a medium model. Okay. Now we have to give a system prompt. So I'm just giving a simple one. You are a competitor analysis expert for interview. Okay. Start. Take the competitors names from the Google sheet. And collect all required information. Analyze them. And give the analysis as a structured table. Table and send that table as a mail. Okay. I'm just saying this simple way you just give. But once you give this one. In the paid version. So you what you can do is if you're not using a paid version. You just take this one to charge. You put the say that you are creating an agent in make.com. Now I want to improve in like refine my prompt. Otherwise there is an option here. Improve. So just if you want to add some feature into it. Like you're just checking your agent. It has left out something. So I want to add that particular feature. You can give it here. Otherwise you know you can improve this one. Will come to that later. Maybe after adding all the tools. If you improve that will give better response. That is why. So if you have some documents that is for your reference. Like previous competitor analysis. You can just say that you know you just refer to this. And I have to get the output in this format. See for example there is a spreadsheet data or sales data. You have created a dashboard. And you want to create a paper table or something. You want the data into being that format. Those kind of things where you are guiding your output to being that format. Just add it in the context and put it in the system prompt. Okay. Whatever you want to do. Already existing documents. Mail templates. You want to write a personalized email. Just you have some response. Like for example if a spheta is there. She is talking to the instructors. You know they have some refined policy. And then you want an automated response to be generated for the instructor for certain queries. Like they are asking for a hike. We say that you know weight tells gently. So we do that right. So those kind of queries if you have it in the document. Put it in the context. So it will take. For example, opt team. This is a team. If you have you know previous. previous history. History. History. Ticket resolution. History. Just take where and put it in the context. All these things can go in context. Like whatever we have discussed for custom GPT is applicable here as well. Now coming to the tool spot. I'm just clicking here. Now we'll go simple one module. I'm selecting a module. If I have a module I can select. But now we are going to create a module. Just ignore this one because I have created these things. So it's getting listed here. But I want to create a module. So I'm just clicking create. Now we need a Google Sheets. What we have to do. What we'll be having the Google Sheets. The names of the competitors. So when we have names in the competitors. It's not going to add a row or update a row. It's going to search for them. It will go to get the content of the row. See for example, if there is some keyword that you want to search. You can go for search rows. So you want to update a particular row. You can go for these options. Like update. And then now there is something called. If you want to create an entire spreadsheet on your own, you can go for this one. In this spreadsheet, if you want to add a particular sub-shed you go for this one. So similarly there are multiple actions. So what we want is. Returns the sheets content. Defined by range values. This is what we want. I have a sheet. I have some content. I want to just get that particular content. So we go for this one. Now again. The name. Whatever you give here. See give the tool a clear descriptive name that reflects his purpose. For example, Gmail, send an email to new context. Okay. Now Google Sheets. What we have to do. Get the names of the competitors. Okay. Just an indicator because the agent has to agent learns everything from the natural language that we are giving. So whatever tools we are giving. Whatever help we can do from R side. If you make that clear, agents will dynamically desired what it has to do and then it will buffer. Okay. Now what is the description. Get the names of the competitors. Off interview. Okay. Start. Here. Now just like we did for our previous book. Open AI and then the G main just set up the connection. Now. Carthika sorry to interrupt. Mr. out for this context. What was the for Google sheet? What was the one that we are supposed to use in this context? Get range values. Get range values. Now let me show you. I already created a Google sheet. What you have to do is we have to create a Google sheet. Put the list in in column A. Okay. I am just having the list of the competitors. Okay. I will show you that as well. I hope you are able to see my shared or that screen as well. My shared screen. Can you see? Yeah. You are searching something. That one right. But it is new programs. It just gives me one moment. Okay. Let me show you after this gets over how the sheet is looking like. Imagine that I have created a new sheet in column A. I have names like simply drawn great learning. Something like that. That's it. Nothing much. Okay. Now I am going to find that particular sheet. You have to give. For you remember when we connected our custom GPT or Chariot GPT with the connector G drive directly. We are able to give the name of the particular file. It will take off all the data right. Here also we have to search by path. So what is the path from my drive? I am going to give the path. Just check here. Like I am in Observe carefully. Click here to choose the file. So if I click this one. A plane slash indicates my drive. So if I click on slash it indicates my entire drive. Now I want to give a spreadsheet ID right. So just click on this place. The name of my file is. IK underscore competitors. So whatever spreadsheet you have already for any other scenario. Also you already have a spreadsheet ready. So you want to use that. You use this method. So I get a company. I will show you this sheet. How is it looking like? Now automatically this field comes in. Once you give this sheet. This field comes in. And the sheet. Only once he did contains. Okay. So this is like a bug here in this add mode. You'll do it in make itself. So don't worry. Some three times it gets listed. So once you select that it will automatically get populated. And three other fields also. Now this is very important. Now in my range. For example, just imagine this scenario. I have a Google sheet. Right now I have 10 competitors. I have given the names. Maybe after three months I might have some 20 more competitors. Also. So every time you. You need not go and give the range manually. Right. This is applicable for any kind of scenario that you are using also. When you don't want anything to be man very updated on the agent has to dynamically pick up something. Always go for this one. This in like makes your task very simple. Whether the table that is the Excel sheet is going to contain any header. That is the title. Compatators and then something like that. If you have given any. First row usually we give it a title. So that also let the agent decide. We are giving agent decide. Okay. Row with headers also agent decide. So when about you get this option always in agents while creating agents. Let the agent decide. Okay. Now I have this one. We have seen that chatty but he is not giving deterministic response. Right. Similarly agents also will not give you deterministic response. It is up to us to refine it step by step step by step. Okay. Now this is we are getting the name of the competitors. Now I want to send a mail. So now for that I am just adding the Gmail module. Gmail module you know already how to do. Just go. Okay. Okay. This is create module to Gmail. We have to send an email. Nothing. Gmail send an email sends a new email. The description you need not change. If you want to send send a send a send the. Compatator. Put it on this is. Table. Since a new email. Now to we have to give the recipient. For example, two also it has to decide based on some documents that document you are giving you know in the context or something. Then you can in those cases you can allow AI agent to decide also. Now I am just giving here. Now subject line I want agent to decide. The body type as we have seen. Select this as raw HTML because we are not segregating this one. Content it will decide on its own. Just add. So where were you have the option you just select on this one. Then we will come for improving because we have used the tools right. So now let's try to improve this prompt. Let's see how it's improving. Just check this out. It is automatically given in the RCFT format. What is the role you are a competitor analysis agent. You do this one. See gather the required. Whatever we have given or that becomes a role in objective. Like read this instructions. Use the Google sheets get the names of the competitors tool to obtain the competitor name. Collect any additional data needed for Tharao analysis. Create a well formatted table summarizing analysis. Send the table via email with this tool. Okay. Do not add irrelevant information or personal opinions. Okay. Something like this. First it has to retrieve the competitors. It has to gather data, build a table and send email. If you want to refine this, just go and refine. Let's check once actually this one. And if you find that there is a fault. There is an error in our output. Just we can go ahead and improve that particular step only by giving it. Or manually we can edit it. Okay. Now let's save this one. Now I'm saying do the competitor analysis. And send the mail. So just see here. It's thinking the agent is taking the names from Google sheets. Get the names of the competitors. And automatically we haven't designed the flow. Right? We haven't. Here in words only we have mentioned that it has to follow that flow. Now let's check what is the output. Just once again I'm sharing the other screen. To show you the output. See, interview Kickstarter, competitor analysis report. Can you see this guys? Yes. See how structured. How difficult it was for us to send that one summary. Bring that in proper format and everything. But see the agent has done everything like this. Okay. Just give out a give a try of this use case. Maybe after the class also. Yeah, received it. You you tried great. You're getting the table right. Yeah, I added a table on the sheet of few instructors and. Oh, nice. So guys like try this out. Anybody anyone else tried for a different scenario. Also you can try. I'm stuck with this the Google connection first. The spreadsheet ID where would I get that because I think this one is with you with you right. The one that you created. You create a new sheet. Oh, myself. I create one. You create new sheet and you refer to that new sheet by giving the name there. It will automatically get connected. You had that particular sheet. So that is why you know I connected that sheet. Maybe I'll show you that sheet for your reference also. Let AI agent decide is the option that you're recommending. You should do just below the range option. It says let AI agent decide. You give any any see see you just. For example, you want to do a quarterly report of something. Okay, just give that entire data is present in a spreadsheet. You want to do a quarterly summary of that particular sheet. Just give that sheet and ask the agent to summarize. It will summarize it a very good way and send the response like to all the stakeholders. Every time you need not mention that and every start of the. Every start of the month you want to do something. You want to take particular spreadsheet or the maybe the end of the month. You want to you have all the sales data or something is available. Then you want to take that and do a comparative analysis of the previous quarter or something. Then you want to send it to all stakeholders. You can automate an agent with the help of that. Okay, anyone else tried guys. I haven't tried. I'm just looking at the things I'm planning to. Just give give a try. Don't worry. We have the coaching session also. So we can try that together in the coaching session as well. But don't worry. Like, did you understand the power of agents that's what I. I want to can be. Like whatever we have done in the first first automation. Every single step we have to configure. Now, did you get this question in your mind? Like when should I go for that and when should I go for this. A.R. agents. Did you get that question in your mind? Yes, Karthika, right now. Yes. Because those are workflows. These are agents. When should I go for workflows and when should I go for agents? Now, let's decode that because that is very important for you to select whether you want to go for a workflow or for agents. So workflows, agents workflows of a more predictableity because you know every single step work. Okay, this is where what I'm doing. Like, if there is an error also, it becomes very easy to debug. Because this is the step where I went from. Now, let me rectify that. So when we did not get the proper format of response, we identify that. The prompt has to be refined. So it gives more predictableity. But agents more autonomy here. You did not say anything to the agent. Agent automatically you decide, okay, this is my sheet. This is my data. I will pick the entire data from this sheet. I'll do the analysis and do the flow. The sequence of steps we did not mention. Nothing. We did not mention anything. In everything in the plain language, we have given some instructions. That's it. The agents have have more autonomy. So whenever you want something to be decided dynamically. When your actions are happening, you want to pick up something. You want to decide, okay, I want to take this course of action or that course of action. If the value is this one, I want to do this center email. If this is coming out this way, I want to send us a slack message. So if you have different paths like this, always go for agents. Okay. Now, workflows, explicit step by step logic, it is predictable. So it's like if there are multiple modules you want to connect very lengthy scenarios and it becomes very difficult as a complexity grows. But in the case of agents, what happens is that it's very difficult to debug. As we have seen, we are using LLMs. All these are AI. It's not very deterministic. It requires a lot of efforts to predict and debug. That is the only one. But if you are able to give precise instructions and natural language because we can take help of other LLMs also. So if you are able to do agents, can do good work. Okay. Now, any questions? I think a very important part which I've missed out while I was ideally doing all this stuff. See, I've added the modules. I've added connected the file that the Google Rep file and the email connection. You may have to connect to established the Gmail connection. Given a simple prompt, right? How do I run it? Ah, on the right hand side, there is a window, right? That is where you have to check how your agent is working. Just give, do the competitor analysis and send the mail. Something like that. Start anything. Is it, it will work. Right side, can you see? There is a prompt. I do see from here. Just start asking to do the competitor analysis and send the mail. No, I did not do competitor analysis because that file I did not have. So I had an FAQ. FAQ or certain questions. So I touched that file and I gave an instructor as an instructor. For interview, you can start please summarize the content. Did not table in the form of FAQ, frequently asked questions and they are corresponding answers. This is what I've given a simple prompt, right? Let's give any kind of query to that competitor. I mean, sorry, the agent. Okay. It will exactly do whatever you have done. You, however you have described the steps. I did not add anything in context and all right. That's not the problem. You have given specific clear instructions what it has to do in the system prompt, right? Okay. Yes. That is what it do. So here I've mentioned, given the summary. Hmm. And on the right hand side. Hmm. Thinking. If you have added tools, it will make use of the tools. You can see that also. Hmm. For some reason, it is just going on. Okay. I got an output. Hmm. Okay. Give me the summary. Okay. I got a column for under the, okay, I'll just show you. Hmm. Yeah. Makes more sense. Is this the expected one? Yes. Yes. Just not that the, I mean, I would probably want it to be in a forward. It's a, it's a table format, but not inside a table. Like under under it, it's in the grid in a grid format. Do you see this? Uh, yeah. I'm just looking. Okay. Yeah. It's, it has come like frequently and it's in the table of, Tablet format only, but then the borders are not added. Yeah. Yeah. The grid is not closed. Yeah. It becomes very simple, right? Can you understand the difference between the first one and this one? Like now it is all doing on its own. Agent is doing on its own. No, no. Yeah. Great. There is a pole still open and please, like if anyone of you hasn't, uh, Fill the form, I mean, pole, please do fill. That will be like a motivation for us and also we can, uh, perform better than the next sessions also. Based on your feedback and that'll be a feedback form also circulated. Please do that. Um, one second, like, can you, uh, same as cream? We'll see a few questions which I want you to answer. Okay. Finally. Um. Please. Okay. Okay. Carthika can we drop off? I mean, is there anything else? We have to understand the first one. We already can do five minutes on top. No, no, no. Nothing. Nothing much with the quiz. We can end the class. Yeah. Okay. Just give me one second. Okay. Can it help you, Dan? Can it help you, Dan? So for this one, guys. Like if you want to automatically send a welcome email, when a word a new user fills out a Google form. So which of the following should be your trigger module? Which one? What is the trigger module basically? The, uh, Google, Google, Google form. Yes, Google forms because it's the first module, right? So that is the trigger module. Uh, it will detect the new form, like watch responses. So it will watch for your responses and if there is a new submission, it triggers your workflow automatically. Now, if you are doing some insights for each competitor, okay. Just, uh, this one is like, it will combine. If there are multiple data, we haven't covered this one. This is covered in, you know, the other video. You can just please refer to this one video. Whenever you find time. And we have seen this one. Whenever you run on some problem in a scenario, like how will you troublesht it? Should there be a issue where will you go and look into? Something we have seen. When? When? When? Connection settings in Gmail. That is for Gmail particular module. Right. There is an entire problem in scenario itself. How will you understand that? In a scenario log. Yes, logs always go to the logs and check what is the error message. Okay. Now, we'll summarize whatever we have seen. So, we'll automate the not a bit of business workflows. Focusing more on strategy and innovation with the help of this one. And what is a scenario? It's an automated workflow. Step by step, you're work in a sequential flow that connect multiple applications together. This is a scenario. And what's a module? It's like a single building block of making that particular scenario. It's like different Lego blocks. Every module is a single puzzle block. And then if you connect together, it becomes a scenario. And a bundle is a package of data that flows in the scenario from one module to another. There will be input bundle output bundle. You can check that by clicking on that. Checkmark. Then trigger and make is a starting. Even there are two types of trigger, time-based trigger and even based trigger. You can set up whatever you want. And then AI agents are like in both flow, you define everything step by step. But AI agents take more autonomy and will decide on your own, perform the tasks on your own. It will assume your role and take decisions on your behalf while taking this far. So any doubts, guys, please do try all these things and then come to the coaching session. We'll be having. They will discuss even more advanced use cases and everything. Please do fill in the bowl and then the feedback form also. That will really be helpful for us. Thanks for joining this session. And anyone is having any problem in the first workflow automation or thing. Please stay back. We will resolve that together. I'll be waiting. Thank you. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Kushal is there. Kushal dropped. Okay. Yeah. Karteka, I think I had the same problem as Kushal, but I missed. I had made was when I had connected my Gmail. There are two steps right one. You click on next and the next time you click next, there's a couple of check boxes. I had not ticked it. Okay. So, I did it on the next time. It's working. Okay. Maybe it's the same. Okay. I will inform Kushal. Okay. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Thanks for joining. Yeah. Thanks, Karteka. Thank you. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Okay, guys. Bye. Thank you.\n"
